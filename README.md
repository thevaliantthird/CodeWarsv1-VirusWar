Have fun playing around!

You need to replace scriptred and scriptblue with respective scripts of your choice.

Have a look at Line 417 of main.py. You can specify the name of the image which you would like to be the map, you can also choose some other map of your own choice.
You can also specify the positions of both the bases as the second and third arguments to the function on the same line!
